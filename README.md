# **How to Host Your Resume on GitHub Pages**
---
### **Purpose**
The purpose of creating this instruction file is to help people who have very little or some experience with GitHub and Web Development, to host their resume online using a **markdown editor**, **Jekyll** and a built-in GitHub's feature - **GitHub Pages**. To do so, a provided instruction set of the process of making it will be shown step by step in the below sections. This instruction is most suitable for people who have limited experience in hosting/formatting resumes online. In this instruction file, I will also explain my choices are Jekyll, Markdown and GitHub Pages using Andrew Etter’s word in his book: **Modern Technical Writing**. To be more specific, I will use a Jekyll template with a theme completely supported by GitHub Pages.

---
### **Prerequisites**
Before stepping into this tutorial, there are several requirements:
* A complete, up-to-date resume (online or hard copy)
* A GitHub account. If you don't have one, simply create it by [Join GitHub](https://github.com/join)
* Basic knowledge of markdown language ( GitHub Flavoured Markdown(GFM) preferred) If you are new to markdown language, then check out this [GitHub markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown).
* A markdown editor: [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are great choices.
* Basic knowledge of Jekyll. For more information, check out [Jekyll Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB)

### **Choices Jekyll provides**
With Jekyll, we have 3 basic options:
* Build a website from scratch like the tutorial in the given link above
* Use GitHub Pages's [existing Jekyll themes](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-theme-chooser#adding-a-theme-with-the-theme-chooser) (very simple and limited).
* Fork a complete template supported by GitHub Pages and then modify it

In this instruction file, I will show you how to get it done with the third option since it is a not-much-more complex but much more interesting approach to using Jekyll.

### **Hosting Resume on GitHub Pages (Using supported template by GitHub Pages) :wrench::wrench::wrench:** 
#### 1. Locate a Jekyll template with a theme completely supported by GitHub Pages
Search for templates with a theme completely supported by GitHub Pages, then select a favourite template, and locate it on GitHub. In this case, I will use [James Grant's template](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme). 

This is the first step to achieve Andrew Etter's goal: **Make Static Websites**. Andrew Etter's love for Static Websites is reasonable since Static websites provide "speed, simplicity, portability, and security”. What he loves, even more, is that static websites can be easily generated by Jekyll: a popular, functional static website generator, which built especially for documentation.

---

#### 2. Fork the template's repository
Fork the repository by clicking on the <mark>`Fork`</mark> option on the upper right-hand side of the page. We go beyond Andrew Etter's recommendation by using the pre-built static website Jekyll repository and extend from it.

---

#### 3. Rename the forked repository 
Rename it by clicking on Settings --> the first option should be Repository Name.

---

#### 4. Clone to your local machine
On the middle right of the repository, select the `Code` dropdown button (in green) and copy the web URL.

On your local machine, locate the folder you want to put the project into, initiate a local git repository.

Use the web URL in the copy clipboard to clone from GitHub to your local repository.   

For more information on how to do so, please check [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).   

Using GitHub is a great way to start knowing the Distributed Version Control System. DVCS allows you to work offline and provide concurrent/asynchronous workflow and many more advantages which is why "developers prefer them" (Andrew Etter 38).

---

#### 5. Open the local repository in your Markdown editor
On your local machine, open Visual Studio Code (or any other recommended Markdown Editor) and open the local repository. I personally recommend VSCode because of its stability and live preview feature.

---

#### 6. Modify yml file to add resume content
Step in and modify the front matter and add your resume content. In the repository, locate to <mark>_data</mark> folder. In there, you will see 3 existing files: **education.yml, experience.yml, projects.yml**. Click on education.yml to open it for editing. 

In the `education.yml` file, edit your resume content follows the format given. My recommendation is to copy that sample code block, paste it, then comment out the sample block, then modify the pasted block.

Continue doing so for `experience.yml` & `projects.yml` to modify your experience and project sections.

The language used to edit the yml file is Markdown - a lightweight markup language. In case you wonder why not go with XML, the lightweight markup language is more human-readable, maintainable and encourage people to contribute more. 

We choose Markdown because Andrew Etter's claim is globally true: it is wonderful and it has the cleanest syntax. The only thing to keep in mind is that you will use GitHub Flavoured Markdown, this is derived from Markdown's drawback, but it does not hurt our previous claim.

#### 7. Edit Personal Info and About Me section
In the main directory of the repo, locate the file named `_config.yml`. Follow the instruction and sample code block to add your Personal Info and About Me section data.

---

#### 8. Push your changes to GitHub
After finish changing/adding contents using GitHub Flavour Markdown, locate the local repository on Terminal and perform a push command to save those changes to the remote repository. 

You can simplify this step by using GitHub Desktop instead of Terminal for a more user-friendly UI.

For more information on how to push to your remote repository, please check [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)

---
#### 9. Access your hosted (by GitHub Pages) website
Go to your repository in GitHub --> Settings --> Scroll down to near-bottom --> GitHub Pages section. You should see your site has been successfully hosted by GitHub Pages at 
`yourusername.github.io`

As suggested by Andrew Etter in Modern Technical Writing, having your website; especially your resume online is better than storing a PDF resume on your hard drives. Those PDF resumes get stale and become harmful by time while an online resume helps you keep things up-to-date with the latest updates and releases.

### **Warning :no_entry::no_entry::no_entry:**
* GitHub Pages take sometimes to refresh and show updated changes, so be patient
* Editing in `_config.yml` requires you to rebuild to update changes
* To add more sections to the resume, you have to add 3 things: 
  * a content file `newsection.yml` in _data folder
  * an HTML file for that new section in `_includes folder`
  * Edit in `default.html` in the _layout folder. For more infomation, please check [here](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme/blob/master/_layouts/default.html) and [here](https://i.imgur.com/8I0etYW.png)

### **FAQs :question::question::question:**
**1. Is there any easier way to build a Jekyll website besides forking supported templates?**

* Yes, there is. As stated in the "Choices Jekyll provides" section, you can use GitHub Page's existing Jekyll themes, which is very simple. You only need to manipulate config.yml and index.md files only.

**2. Why should I use Markdown? Isn't only for documentation?**

* Markdown is very simple and has the following advantages in the table below, and it is famous for being used in online documentation, but Jekyll has amazingly integrated markdown into static web development. Now, you can easily create a website using mostly Markdown, isn't it great? 

   |              Advantage             |               Drawback                |
   |------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
   | Easy to understand                 | No standard format                    |
   | Support easy formatting            | Not a HTML/XML replacement            |
   | the syntax is clean                | Not extensible and limited            |
